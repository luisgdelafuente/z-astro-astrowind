Your site is currently using Netlify Identity, which is now deprecated. Existing implementations will continue to function, but we no longer provide support for Identity-related issues.  We recommend exploring the Auth0 extension for more features and future support. If you would like to migrate, you can contact support to receive a secure export of your Identity data, including hashed passwords.  Contact Support
